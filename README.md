# Yaml block highlight

Provide syntax highlight for yaml block string in editor, to use it like markdown fenced code.

Usage: put a comment after `|` to indicate language used. For example `# js`, and the block string will be colored as javascript.

Most of the common languages are supported, just like markdown in vscode do.
